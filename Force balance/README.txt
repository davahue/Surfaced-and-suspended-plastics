	0. GENERAL INFORMATION

This folder contains a code (adapted to different conditions):
	- Balance of forces.py

that evaluates submerged weight, bubbles and surface tension forces in a partially submerged cylindrical cup.
The plastic cup geometry is inspired in samples of Cup_PP_100.
The bubble diameter can be changed through variable: d_b.
The number of bubles can be changed through variable: N_b.
The contact angle changed through: angle (excess over 90 degrees).
