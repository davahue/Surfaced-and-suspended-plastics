# Surfaced-and-suspended-plastics
Codes and processed data accompanying the analysis of experimental tests disclosing on physics of surfaced and suspended buoyant plastics and the bias and uncertainty in their sampling in rivers.

Contributors: Daniel Valero, Antonio Moreno and Biruk S. Belay.

All processed data, raw data (except videos due to size constraints) and codes of analysis are included in this repository.

This repository includes the following folders (alphabetical order):

  - Bubbles attached to plastics:
Laboratory observations of bubbles attached to plastics (cups, fragments and films) exposed at different velocities (V1 and V5).

  - Camera processing and 3D tracks:
Example code for the camera automatic positioning, calibration, plastic detection and tracking.

  - Flume hydrodynamics:
Codes and ADV data for the characterization of the flow mean and turbulent quantities. Final (summary xlsx) data also included.

  - Force balance:
Analysis of the relative effect of different forces acting on a plastic cup at different submergence levels.

  - Plastic concentrations:
Detailed data resulting from the analysis of plastic trajectories for each experiment (plastic by plastic statistics). It also includes an analysis of how different monitoring strategies perform for the experimental data obtained.

  - Plastic density - pycnometer:
Result from the pycnometer analysis (plastic density estimations).

  - Plastic trajectories:
Trajectories extracted from RAW videos using the codes of "Camera processing and 3D tracks".
