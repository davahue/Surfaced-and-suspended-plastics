	0. GENERAL INFORMATION

We inserted 20 different samples following our insertion protocol for the following plastic samples: Cup_PP_100, Cup_PP_05 and Film_HDPE_15; for the lowest and highest discharges considered in the transport experiments (V1 and V5). We held the plastic samples close to the channel glassed wall without releasing them and identified the number of bubbles attached to the plastic element. The diameter could not be accurately determined, but it was classified within the following groups: small, medium and large; which roughly correspond to ≪ 1 mm, ~1 mm, and ≫ 1 mm.
